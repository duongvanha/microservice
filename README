# Setup infra for learning

# Terraform

Terraform create Infrastructure by code.
- demo

Terraform create Infrastructure by code ( gke ):

- copy file env/microservices.json (credential for google cloud)

- terraform plan for review infra, terraform apply for apply infra


## Notes issue

- Using same version openssl encrypt and decrypter
- Kubeadm ( setup hosted kubernetes cluster not using gke because begin learning ðŸ˜­)
`https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1390
Instead of using --apiserver-advertise-address=publicIp use --apiserver-cert-extra-sans=publicIp
Don't forget to replace the private ip for the public ip in your .kube/config if you use kubectl from remote.`

- Istio require memory and CPU
`As per "https://docs.giantswarm.io/guides/deploying-istio/"
Some of them, as pilot, have a large impact in terms of memory and CPU, so it is recommended to have around 8GB of memory and 4 CPUs free in your cluster. Obviously, all components have requested resources defined, so if you donâ€™t have enough capacity you will see pods not starting.`

- Istio gateway
`https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/ingress-control/#determining-the-ingress-ip-and-ports"
Some cloud provider support `
